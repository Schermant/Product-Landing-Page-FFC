# Product-Landing-Page-FFC

Hello there!
This is my first attempt at coding and designing a product landing page using HTML and vanilla CSS, as a project for the freeCodeCamp course "Responsive Web Design", they are real cool, check them out.

Okay maybe not a product landing page but a whole home page.

DISCLAIMER: The "Scarab Saigon" restaurant was registered by Senchasou Co. Ltd, any and all uses of the name "Scarab Saigon" as well as documents and images related are non-commercial and therefore not for profit. Any derivative use of the images and documents related to "Scarab Saigon" from this work is strongly advised to seek permission from Senchasou Co. Ltd, and the author of this work is not responsible for any and all infringement of copyright law should the mentioned items be used irresponsibly. This work is a way for me to show respect to one of my favorite restaurant that unfortunately had to shut down because of COVID, and is by no mean for profit.

Timeline:
- May 29 2023: Primary product completed.

Future plan if I revisit this:
- Put in a script.js for animation at scroll.
- Making a proper menu viewer.
- Making a GET route for "/reservation" that links to a booking form and a POST route to store entries from that form into a database, preferably MySql or Planetscale.
- MAYBE host it online to study response time once I have money.

Sample for studying:
- Basic web design.
- Viewport-responsive design.
- Scrollbar modifier.
- Image and background image masking.
- Linking images from GG Drive.
- Setting up Google Fonts to use fonts.
